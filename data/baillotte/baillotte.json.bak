What a discovery! Food is wonderful! No better than that. Taste, presentation and concept - perfect.

I happened to get the seat facing the window into the kitchen, and I really enjoyed seeing the diverse team at work together. They seemed to communicate really well with each other, and they seemed to take pleasure in seeing the diners enjoying their food. Every dish was presented beautifully, and service was warm and inviting. My favorite dish was the lamb — gorgeous to the eye and the flavors bold and delicious. My daughter and I also loved the pistachio soufflé. Definitely worth the wait. Best meal I have had all year!"

We saw this restaurant - knew nothing about it - but it looked very cozy and the menu looked quite interesting and reasonably priced. In we went - perfect choice.\n\nThe staff was very welcoming even though we didn't have a reservation and now realize that it's generally a good idea to do so. I had the duck breast, my partner the fish. Both were super good in a very-well-put-together kind of way. Versus an experimental innovative kind of way.\n\nThis set the bar high for Parisian meals and, in fact, in a week stay in the city, we had only one other meal that was at this level of good.\n\nThere are many restaurants in Paris obviously, so it's hard to say you have to seek this out if you're coming from a couple of arrondissements away. But if you're in this area, then yes, for sure give it a try."

      "en": "For a restaurant of Japanese chef and Asian kitchen staff, the service was disappointing towards non-Japanese Asian tourists. We were sitting between two white couples and it did not take us long to notice that every piece of service arrived later than the neighbors. The dessert menu from the lady took verbal reminder to finally arrive while the couples next to us got the menu, got the order picked up and got to finish their dessert seamlessly. They also got one starter mistakenly and we took that without calling it out.\n\nThe place is very crowed that every bit of small talk goes into the next tables. The tables are so close to each other that sitting at the long couch means no toilet the entire dinner.\n\nThe highlight of the restaurant might be its obvious Japanese influence in flavoring and ingredients. But given its majority clientele of tourist and near half from Asia, the menu may have come across as missing the authenticity of French cuisine and its spirited authenticity.\n\nOverall we were disappointed after we booked the place a month in advance due to the overall expedience, its service and lack of character."

The pollock (fish) was overcooked. Plating was gorgeous, kitchen staff worked in harmony, wait staff was attentive and friendly. The atmosphere and service 5/5, food\nwas 4/5 but can definitely be 5/5 with some refinement. Definitely worth checking out regardless."

      "en": "We took two dishes for each, and all four of them proved to be absolutely delicious, well thought-out and beautifully presented. Service was quite welcoming and fast. Location is better than in most other places- the street is relatively quiet with not too much traffic, so it's nice to seat outside.\nThroughout our visit to Paris we had multiple poor restaurant experiences, and we have noticed that many mediocre restaurants have artificially pumped reviews. This one however, fully deserves the 4.8 rating it had at the moment of our visit. The only \"complaint\" that I would mention is that just like in many other places in Paris, drinks prices are unseasonably high."

      "en": "We came to Baillote to have a nice French dinning experience.\n\nFor a starter, we tried the Langoustine Raviolis. The portion is quite small and pricy, 3 raviolis are 26€. However the flavor was amazing. The sauce was so delicious we almost licked the plates. I personally don’t mind the high prices when the food exceeds my expectations.\n\nAs our mains, we tried some classics. The duck and the fish.\n\nThe duck was the best duck we have eaten in Paris. It was tender, the skin was crispy. Really well cooked.\n\nThe fish was rich and fatty and the sauce was nice. It was good, not mind blowing. But exceeded my expectations given that most restaurants serve you quite bland boiled fish.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the Mango Variation and the Chai Tea Soufflé.\n\nThe Chai Tea soufflé was quite nice. It had a nice texture and flavor. The Cointreau ice cream that comes with it was very unique and had a nice floral flavor. We really enjoyed this dessert.\n\nThe mango variation was mind blowing. The crispiness of the cookie, the slightly chewy texture of the cheese and the contrast of the sour lemon sorbet and mango made it a unique experience. The flavors and textures balance in a delightful and refreshing way. I am happy to say this is the best dessert I have eaten in my life. It was so good we ordered another one.\n\nThe service was great and kind. We really enjoyed our time here 🕺🏻"

The dishes are crafted by Japanese master chefs using classical French techniques and only the finest ingredients. The langoustine ravioli starter was delicate and perfectly balanced, the lamb was tender and full of flavor, and the fish of the day was flawlessly cooked. The rich chocolate dessert was a standout finale, deeply satisfying without being overwhelming. All of it paired with impeccable service and a warm, elegant interior that made the entire experience feel special. It’s not just a meal—it’s a masterclass in culinary harmony. I’ll definitely go again."

The texture of the fish just melted in the mouth, and the sauce was too good to not mop it up with my bread.\n\nPlays - Pêche du Jour\nSmelt like being at the seaside. A more complicated and conflicting dish. Flavours and textures that alone would be okay, were a little confusing together. I didn’t dislike it, but I didn’t love it. Especially not as much as the entrée. Compared to that and the dessert, the main course was a punk rock band. Maybe the was the point?\n\nDessert - Tomate D’Été\nThis was back to the form of the starter. Aroma, flavour, texture was all in harmony. I have NEVER heard of tomatoes being used in a dessert, not this was perfect and the tomatoes really worked. The most cleaning dish I have ever had. And left a slight tingle on the tongue as it cleared away interfering flavours from the past!\n\nA little detour on the main course, but a solid 4/5 from me!"

      "en": "We are retired age couple traveling with friends.   Booked dinner at Baillotte based on reviews and location.   We were greeted nicely and promptly for our 7 pm reservation however host “pointed” at our table vs taking us to same so we headed to wrong table ..   Small detail but….    Ambiance and decor of restaurant is very well done and has been curated by someone who has a nice talent for same.   As we looked to order my wife, who is a light eater wanted to order only an entree but was curtly informed it was mandatory to order a “plat” (main course).   I understand it’s a smaller restaurant needing to generate revenue but have never experienced being told that one must order a certain course “or else”.   In any case we went with the flow..I ordered scallops in a white sauce entree and veal plat (main).   Then between us 2 orders of a vegetarian main and 2 orders of veal.  My scallop entree was beautifully presented and the scallops were cooked to perfection.  The white sauce had a perfect texture but I found it to be lacking in “complexity” of taste - but overall good.  My veal main was good but felt the veal was not as tender and flavorful as I was hoping but overall pleasant.   Three ala carte glasses of wine were good but felt the size of the pour was in the light side (maybe 1/6 of a glass???).  Prices fair but not inexpensive.  Having been somewhat put off by being told it was mandatory to order a plat (main) we decided to opt out of desert course and went for ice cream elsewhere.\nOwnership of “Baillotte” are clearly working hard to present a wonderful atmosphere and haute cuisine but missed the mark for us…but perhaps that was “us and not them”.   The other reviews here certainly suggest that the large majority of patrons have a very positive experience!"

Technically it was perfect, with crispy charred skin and juicy, slightly undercooked (but cooked) meat. Not that many wines by the glass, and relatively pricey, but I guess it is normal for this range."
